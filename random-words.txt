this is a new start my dissertation. Now I have to learn all techniques that I
need and process my fuckign dissertation as soon as possible. At the same
time, I am using Github and MacVim to help me process my writing and keeping
myself organized. 

Voila! 

Just did this one from my pte-imac.
Date: 2/10/2015

Today, I want to see if I can import bibtex into the git and also using tex to
edit my dissertation.

Second thing that I have to do is set up my schedule. This is extremely
important as I really don't have time to do so. 

This line is now added by MacVim. Git is synced to Googel Drive. Remember to
use "\ " for space in the liuux system.

Now the infrastructure is set up. All I need to do is write and write and
write! 

Last time to do is to add branch to the master branch so that most of
documents can be tracked properly.

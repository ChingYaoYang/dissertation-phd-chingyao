\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Enzyme Applications}

The catalytic properties of enzymes led to extensive development in industries
as briefly discussed in the previous chapter \ref{tab:protein-app} (Table
\ref{tab:protein-app}). For example, protease was developed for the purpose of
detergent\cite{Kirk2002}. After several iterations of development, protease
were engineered to meet requirements in detergents.  However, the limitations
of applications were constantly resulted from the inactivation of enzymes. The
inactivation factors included heat \cite{Shirley1995,Perdana2012,Etzel1996,Gouda2003},
proteolysis \cite{VandenBurg2002a,Ahmad2012}, organic solvents
\cite{LeJeune1997a,Izutsu2009,Stepankova2013}, etc. These limitations motivated
scientists to find solutions in order to take advantage of enzymes activity,
specificity and other attractive features. The followings are the discussion of
these limitations.

\subsubsection{Heat Inactivation}

It is known that enzymes are sensitive to temperatures\cite{Perdana2012,Etzel1996}. For
example, glucose oxidase \cite{Gouda2003} and $beta$-galactosidase
\cite{Melchers1970} are susceptible to heat inactivation. Gouda \latin{et al.}
demonstrated glucose oxidase irreversibly inactivated over the temperature range
\SIrange{25}{80}{\celsius} \cite{Gouda2003} (Figure \ref{fig:heat-inactivation-exmaple}).

temperatures \cite{Gouda2003}.} 
    \label{fig:heat-inactivation-exmaple} 
\end{figure}
% -------------------------- 

To improve the thermal stability of glucose oxidase, additives such as salts,
mono- and polyhydric alcohols, and polyelectrolytes were added
\cite{Appleton1997,Gouda2003}. To understand the stabilization by salts
such as \ce{NaCl} and \ce{K2SO4}, Gouda \latin{et al.} determined thermal
unfolding transitions of glucose oxidase in the presence of \SI{0.6}{\Molar}
\ce{NaCl} and \SI{0.2}{\Molar} \ce{K2SO4} by CD measurements \cite{Gouda2003}
(Figure \ref{fig:heat-inactivation-improve}). 
% --------------------------heat-inactivation-improvement

T\textsubscript{m} measured at 274 nm were shifted from 62 to 68 and
\SI{72}{\celsius} for native enzyme, \SI{0.2}{\Molar} \ce{K2SO4}, and
\SI{0.6}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl} stabilized glucose oxidase, respectively. Using such
stabilizing effects of salts, they successfully demonstrated how the
heat limitations could be overcame. 

\subsubsection{Proteolysis}

Proteolytic resistance of a protein limits its application
\cite{Ottesen1967,Daniel1982,Fontana2004}. Investigations into relationship
between protein stability and proteolytic resistance revealed that the
resistance is dependent on stability of the protein \cite{Daniel1982,
Parsell1989}. For example, \latin{B. subtilis} lipase was developed for the
synthesis of biopolymers and biodiesel, and the production of enantiopure
pharmaceuticals \cite{Jaeger2002,Ahmad2012}. Ahmad \latin{et al.} determined
the protease resistance of lipase around 55 minutes. Upon the inactivation from
protease, residual activity of wild-type lipase exhibited 55.2\% after four
hours incubation at \SI{37}{\celsius} \cite{Ahmad2012}. (Figure
\ref{fig:protease-resistance})
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig3_14}
    \caption[Proteolytic resistance of wild-type lipase and its variants

Subtilisin A. Mutations listed in the figure were generated by site-saturation
mutagenesis.]{Proteolytic resistance of wild-type lipase and its variants
    measured as post proteolysis residual activity, after incubation with
    Subtilisin A. Mutations listed in the figure were generated by
    site-saturation mutagenesis \cite{Ahmad2012}.}
    \label{fig:protease-resistance}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

To increase both stability and protease resistance, Ahmad \latin{et al.}
generated a library of mutations of lipase through site-saturated mutagenesis.
Focused on the loop and surface residues of this enzyme, they then compared the
wild-type and mutations unfolding profiles and residual activities. By
introducing mutation M137P, lipase transition temperatures was raised by
\SI{6.8}{\celsius}, and the protease resistance was increased to ~955 minutes.
The residual activity was also elevated to 92.5\% \cite{Ahmad2012} (Figure
\ref{fig:protease-resistance}).

\subsubsection{Organic Solvent Inactivation}

One of the limitations to the use of enzymes is instability under processing
conditions, such as the use of organic solvent systems \cite{Stepankova2013}.
Although water serves as a ideal solvent, it is a rather poor solvent for
synthetic reactions \cite{Serdakowski2008}. However, enzymes become inactive at
an organic co-solvent concentration of 60\% to 70\% \cite{Stepankova2013}. For
example, Stepankova \latin{et al.} investigated the co-solvent effects on
haloalkane dehalogenases, DbjA, DhaA, and LinB. These enzyme catalyze the
hydrolytic cleavage of the carbonâ€“halogen bonds of halogenated aliphatic
compounds, and have been engineered for bio-degradation industry
\cite{Stepankova2013a,Koudelakova2013} (Figure \ref{fig:hld}).
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig3_16} 
    \caption[Simplified scheme of the reaction mechanism of haloalkane
    dehalogenase. Hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond proceeds by the

for catalysis]{Simplified scheme of the reaction mechanism of haloalkane
    dehalogenase. Hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond proceeds by the
    SN2, followed by the addition of water. Water is the only co-factor
    required for catalysis \cite{Koudelakova2013}.} 
    \label{fig:hld}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

Stepankova \latin{et al.} demonstrated that addition of high concentrations of
organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and
tetrahydrofuran, resulted in variations in the CD spectra, indicating a loss of
$\alpha$-helical structures \cite{Stepankova2013a} (Figure
\ref{fig:organic-effect}) It was also demonstrated decreased activity of Dha
with increasing co-solvent concentration. LinB was inactivated by most
co-solvents at low concentrations (less than 10\%).
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig3_15} 
    \caption[Circular dichroism spectra of (A) DbjA and (B) DhaA in the
    presence of organic co-solvents. The spectra were measured at
\SI{37}{\celsius} in phosphate buffer (\SI{50}{\milli\Molar}, pH 7.5) and
various organic co-solvents at concentrations that caused reductions in enzyme
activity of more than 90\%. DMF, dimethylformamide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
THF, tetrahydrofuran.]{Circular dichroism spectra of (A) DbjA and (B) DhaA in

    various organic co-solvents at concentrations that caused reductions in
    enzyme activity of more than 90\%. DMF, dimethylformamide; DMSO, dimethyl
    sulfoxide; THF, tetrahydrofuran \cite{Stepankova2013a}.}
    \label{fig:organic-effect} 
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

To address this issue, Dravis \latin{et al.} developed strategies to
stabilize enzymes in organic solvents. The use of immobilized enzymes
represents the most common method to improve enzyme stability toward organic
solvents \cite{Koudelakova2013,Dravis2001}. The enzyme was covalently coupled
to an inorganic polyethyleneimine impregnated alumina (PEI-alumina) with a
glutaraldehyde linker. The results demonstrated that the soluble dehalogenase
was completely inactivated (half life was less than 10 minutes) in presence of organic
media. On the contrary, The immobilized enzyme exhibited activity in the pure
1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) solvent, demonstrating a half-life of nearly 10
hours.

\subsubsection{Other Methods}

While there are limitations of uses of enzymes, other methodologies are
developed to stabilize enzymes, such as entrapment
\cite{Trelles2013,Bhosale1996,Etzel1996}. Entrapment is used in industrial
scale enzyme operations. As enzymes of interest are intracellular, it is easier
to use whole-cell entrapment where the enzyme is synthesized in bacteria.
\cite{Trelles2013} (Figure \ref{fig:enzyme-entrapment})
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig3_04}
    \caption[Schematic drawing of the agar or agarose entrapment
    procedure]{Schematic drawing of the agar or agarose entrapment
        procedure.\cite{Trelles2013}}
    \label{fig:enzyme-entrapment} 
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

One of examples of this is glucose isomerase (GI), which has been used in the
commercial production of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) \cite{Bhosale1996}.
There are reported more than 6 millions tons of HFCS per year produced by GI.
Compared with chemical isomerization, using enzyme not only increased the
purify of the product fructose \cite{Barker1975}, but also enhanced sweetness
\cite{Bhosale1996}. To save the cost of isolating GI, the whole-cell
entrapment was developed to adapt the increased demand of such enzyme
\cite{Trelles2013}. 

\subsection{PTE and Its Applications}

Phosphotriesterase (PTE) is a dimeric protein that hydrolyzes a wide range of
organophosphates (OPs). PTE has been demonstrated to neutralize OPs, such
pesticides and chemical weapons (Section \ref{sec:pte-intro}), and such
property makes PTE an excellent agent for detoxification. Current treatments
for OPs rely on compounds that competitively bind to acetylcholine esterase
(AChE) ,and reactivate AChE after exposure to OPs. Different strategy gives PTE
great potential to compete with current treatments as PTE directly neutralize
the toxins. 

To extend the application of PTE, immobilization has been developed on trityl
agarose resin, allowing decontamination of OPs such as paraoxon, parathion, and
coumaphos \cite{Caldwell1991}. Caldwell \latin{et al.} chose trityl agarose
because of the high coupling properties and the high retention of activity upon
the immobilization of enzymes. Figure \ref{fig:pte-app-imm} demonstrates the
correlation between the flow rate, paraoxon concentration and the percentage of
hydrolysis. A 50\% hydrolysis of paraoxon was achieved with flow rate of
\SI{11.5}{\mL\per\hour}. Experiments were also conducted at the 1.0 and 10-unit
reactors. Unfortunately, the organic solvent dissociated the enzyme from the
reactor.

    \label{fig:pte-app-imm}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

The other application was developed for the decontamination of
organophosphates
\cite{Cheng1996,LeJeune1997a,Little1989,Chen1998,Gill2000,Havens1993,Masson2009a}.
NATO project 31 previously conducted research on several methods for PTE
stabilization \cite{Defrank}, such as foam \cite{LeJeune1997a}, microemulsion
\cite{Cheng1996}, and polyurethane \cite{Defrank}. One advantage is that this
enzyme-based decontamination would provide a significant logistical reduction
during the processing (25 to 50 fold) \cite{Defrank}. One of the examples is
the foam formulation that was developed by LeJeune \latin{et al.}
\cite{LeJeune1997a} (Figure \ref{fig:pte-foam}).

    \label{fig:pte-foam}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------*

The PTE was immobilized with Hypol polyurethane prepolymers. The immobilization
extended the storage to more than 25 days. They further demonstrated that the
foam also stabilizes PTE at \SI{50}{\celsius} for more than 158 hours in
comparison with soluble enzyme at \SI{50}{\celsius} for merely 1.5 hours. 

\subsubsection{PTE Heat Inactivation}

The heat inactivation affects PTE functionality in solution. The thermostability
studies had been carried out to characterize PTE
\cite{Rochu2002b,Grimsley1997b}. Rochu \latin{et al.} demonstrated the
heat-induced unfolding profile of PTE \cite{Rochu2002b} (Figure
\ref{fig:pte-thermo-inactive}). 
% --------------------------pte-heat-inactivation

    \caption[Effect of heat treatment on the catalytic activity of PTE in

\end{figure}
% --------------------------

Upon elevated temperatures, Rochu \latin{et al.} demonstrated that denaturation
irreversible, leading to aggregates at high temperatures with an apparent
T\textsubscript{m} ~ \SI{75}{\celsius}. Above \SI{46}{\celsius}, a rapid loss
of activity occurred with complete inactivation at \SI{60}{\celsius}. 

\subsubsection{PTE Organic Solvent Inactivation}

Organic solvent has been demonstrated to impact enzymes stabilities and
activities. LeJeune \latin{et al.} investigated the inactivation of PTE by
contacting soluble enzyme with different concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) \cite{Lejeune1997a} (Figure \ref{fig:pte-organic-inactive}).
% --------------------------pte-organic

    \cite{Lejeune1997a}.}
    \label{fig:pte-organic-inactive}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

After DMSO was added to the hydrolysis of paraoxon in
aqueous solution, PTE activity decreased dramatically. LeJeune \latin{et al.}
attributed this phenomenon to sources such as environmental dielectric changes
and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition \cite{Lejeune1997a}. The results
also demonstrated PTE with DMSO concentrations above 40\% exhibited substantial
irreversible effects \cite{Lejeune1997a}.

\subsection{Lactose Monohydrate}

Lactose (\iupac{4-\O-\chembeta-\D-galactopyranosyl-\D-glucopyranose},
\ce{C12H22O11}) is a disaccharide consisting of a \iupac{\D-glucose} and a
\iupac{\D-galactose} joined by a \iupac{\chembeta-1,4-glycosidic} bond (Figure
\ref{fig:lactose-structure}). In the dairy industry, crystallization is a
separation process that refines lactose from whey solutions
\cite{Hourigan2013}. During this operation, the crystallization is considered
as a two-step process; the first is called the nucleation
\cite{Schmitt1999,Wong2014}, and second is the growth of the nucleus.  This
nuclei from the first step grows depending on the condition of supersaturation
of lactose solution.  The lactose crystals are affected by process parameters
and solutions, including, temperature, viscosity, pH, and presence of
impurities \cite{Bhargava1996}. The pH changes the rate of mutarotation, which
is an important factor in lactose crystallization \cite{Hourigan2013}. 
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig3_01}

    structures of $\alpha$- and $\beta$- lactose.}

\end{figure}
% --------------------------

A diagram of a typical $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate (LM) crystal is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:lm-crystal}. The crystals are shaped as tomahawk with one
axis of symmetry. The solvent compositions and temperatures during the
crystallization result in different yields, purities, shapes, and sizes of the
lactose crystals \cite{Hourigan2013}.

        faceted structure \cite{Wong2014}.} 
    \label{fig:lm-crystal} 
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

It has been previously shown that $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate (LM) is capable
of incorporating various macromolecules and biopolymers into its crystal
structure\cite{Wang2001a,Kurimoto1999}. (Figure \ref{fig:lactose-structure}) It
has been hypothesized that this is due to peripheral hydrogen atoms of LM,
which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds to neighboring macromolecules.

        for the guest green fluorescent protein (GFP) \cite{Wang2001a}.}
    \label{fig:lm-intro}
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

Wang \latin{et al.} demonstrated that multiple guests molecules were
crystallized with LM \cite{Wang2001a} such as GFP, Cyt C, lysozyme and RNAse B.
Kurimoto \latin{et al.} investigated the stability of GFP inside the crystals.
Surprisingly, they oriented and stabilized GFP in its native conformation, and
subsequently reconstituted crystals into solution in its native state
\cite{Kurimoto1999}.

In this chapter, the enhanced stability and extended shelf life at room
temperature of PTE within the crystallization of LM would be demonstrated. This
is the first report that uses enzyme kinetic parameter to evaluate the
stability in LM crystal. The formulation provides effective storage of PTE, and
ultimately can be used for multiple applications in agriculture and military. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{General}

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) FluoroTag kit and paraoxon were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).  $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate was also purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals, including \ch{NaCl},
\ch{CoCl2}, Tris-HCl, tryptone, yeast extract, paraoxon, ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, sodium phosphates monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, or
imidazole were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or VWR (Radnor, PA).
96-well plates were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). FPLC
column was purchased from G.E Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). 

\subsection{Protein Expression}
\label{sec:pte-chap3}

PTE DNA, pQE30-PTE, was transformed into AFIQ cells as described in our previous
work\cite{Yang2014a} and Chapter \ref{chap:uaa}. Cells were plated on agar
plates containing \SI{200}{\ug\per\mL} ampicillin, \SI{34}{\ug\per\mL}
chloramphenicol. A single colony was picked and grown in Lysogeny broth (LB)
with \SI{200}{\ug\per\mL} ampicillin, and \SI{34}{\ug\per\mL} chloramphenicol)
at \SI{37}{\celsius}, 300 r.p.m for 16 hours \SI{37}{\celsius} incubation.
Afterwards, \SI{250}{\mL} of LB medium for large-scale expression was
innoculated 1:50 with the overnight culture.  After optical density reached 1.0
at 600 nm, the expression media was supplemented with \SI{1}{\milli\Molar}
isopropyl-$\beta$-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce protein expression.
In addition, \SI{1}{\milli\Molar} of \ce{CoCl2} was added in each
post-induction medium.  After three hours incubation at \SI{37}{\celsius}, 300
r.p.m., the cells were harvested by using 4000 r.p.m centrifugation (Beckman
Coulter, Jersey City, NJ.  F10 rotor) at \SI{4}{\celsius} for 15 minutes and
then resuspended with \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} Tris-HCl, \SI{500}{\milli\Molar}
\ce{NaCl}, \SI{5}{\milli\Molar} imidazole, 10\% glycerol (pH 8.0) and
\SI{100}{\micro\Molar} \ce{CoCl2}. Cell lysate was immediately sonicated 400 kJ
for 1.5 minutes at \SI{4}{\celsius} (Qsonica, Newtown, CT) and then a
clarification spin was performed (20,000 g, \SI{4}{\celsius}, 30 minutes).
Clarified supernatants were loaded into a \SI{5}{\mL} His Trap column (G.E
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) using AKTA FPLC purifier (G.E.  Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ).  Protein elution was generated using 30\% elution buffer B
(\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} Tris-HCl, \SI{500}{\milli\Molar} sodium chloride,
\SI{500}{\milli\Molar} imidazole (pH 8.0)). The purified samples were then
transferred into 3.5K MWCO dialysis SnakeSkin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
for buffer exchange using \SI{12}{\L} \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer
(pH 8.0) at \SI{4}{\celsius} for overnight. The purify of protein was
determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). The protein concentration was measured by Nano-Drop Thermo
Scientific (Waltham, MA).  Dialyzed protein was subjected to crystallization
immediately.

\subsection{Protein Conjugation}

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) kit was used for fluorescein conjugation with
PTE. FITC dissolved in \SI{0.1}{\Molar} sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH
9.0).  (\SI{1}{\mg\per\mL}) was added to the \SI{0.14}{\mg\per\mL} enzyme in
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, \SI{100}{\micro\Molar}
\ce{CoCl2}) to a final ratio of 1:5 (PTE:FITC). The reaction mixture was
incubated for \SI{1.5}{hour} at room temperature in tube rack, then dialyzed
against \SI{2}{\liter} of phosphate buffer (\SI{20}{\milli\Molar}, pH 8.0,
\SI{100}{\micro\Molar} \ce{CoCl2}) at \SI{4}{\celsius} overnight.  The sample
was then transferred to lactose solution for crystallization (see below).

\subsection{Lactose and Crystallization}

To prepare PTE.LM crystals, a total of \SI{0.20}{\milli\gram} purified PTE was
added to \SI{2}{\mL} \SI{0.28}{\gram\per\mL} lactose solution
(\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} PBS buffer, pH 7.4). The super saturated lactose was
prepared by dissolving \SI{0.6}{\gram} $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate into boiled
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} PBS buffer (pH 7.4). PTE protein (in
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer, \SI{100}{\micro\Molar} \ce{CoCl2}, pH
8.0) was prepared according to the procedure in Section \ref{sec:pte-chap3}.
After the lactose solution was cooled down to ~\SI{40}{\celsius},
\SI{0.20}{\gram} PTE was then The mixture was incubated at \SI{6}{\celsius} for
roughly 2.5 weeks until PTE.LM crystals of a suitable size were obtained.
Powder lactose monohydrate (less than \SI{1}{\mg})was used as the seed for
crystallization. The crystals were then harvested by filtration and washed with
distilled water and dried under room temperature. PTE.LM crystals were then
stored in vials at \SI{4}{\celsius} or room temperature for subsequent
microscope studies or paraoxon hydrolysis experiments.

\subsection{Fluorescence Microscopy}

The crystal (F-PTE.LM) was then first observed with Zeiss Axioskop 40
Fluorescence Microscope (Peabody, MA).  Wavelength \SI{495}{\nm} was used for
excitation, and \SI{525}{\nm} was used for emission. 4X object lens was used to
collect images of F-PTE.LM.

\subsection{Enzyme Kinetics}

The crystal (both PTE.LM and PTE.LM-FITC) was reconstituted in
\SI{20}{\micro\liter} sodium phosphate (pH 8.0, \SI{100}{\micro\Molar}
\ce{CoCl2}). Reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically (Synergy H1,
BioTek, Winooski VT) at \SI{405}{\nm} for paraoxon (coefficient =
\SI{17000}{\per\Molar\per\cm}).  Reactions for paraoxon
(\SIrange{13}{104}{\micro\Molar}) was done in 0.4\% methanol.
K\textsubscript{M} and V\textsubscript{max} values were determined by a
Lineweaver-Burk plot.\cite{Baker2011b} The equation used is shown below
(Eq.~\ref{eqn:MM-chap3}): 
\begin{equation} 
    \frac{1}{v} =
    \frac{K\textsubscript{M}}{V\textsubscript{max}}\times\frac{1}{S} +
    \frac{1}{V\textsubscript{max}} 
    \label{eqn:MM-chap3}
\end{equation}
where S represents substrate concentration in \si{\Molar}; K\textsubscript{M}
represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of
V\textsubscript{max}. The data reported is the average of three trials and the
error represents the standard deviation of those trials.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Biosynthesis of PTE And Crystallization of PTE.LM}

Wild-type PTE was synthesized by using pQE30-PTE. After transformation into
AFIQ \latin{E. coli}, expression was performed in LB media. After three hours
of induction with \SI{1}{\milli\Molar} IPTG, pure PTE protein was isolated via
FPLC (Chapter \ref{chap:uaa}), and the purity of protein was analyzed via
SDS-PAGE. After dialysis in \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,
\SI{100}{\micro\Molar} \ce{CoCl2}), the protein concentration was determined to
be \SI{0.139}{\mg\per\mL} by using Nano-Drop.

To prepare the lactose solution of crystallization, we then supersaturated
solutions of LM, and incubated with PTE protein at \SI{40}{\celsius}. At the
rate of \SI{0.5}{\celsius\per\minute}, the mixture was then cooled down to room
temperature. The crystals measuring \SIrange{0.5}{3}{\mm} in length from the
microscope scale were harvested after roughly 2.5 weeks incubation at
\SI{4}{\celsius} (Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-bottle}).

Using over-saturated lactose solution, purified PTE was successfully deposited
into the lactose crystal. Using Zeiss microscope as described in the Materials
and Methods section, the dimension of PTE.LM crystal was calculated at
\SI{3.0}{\mm} (h) $\times$ \SI{1.0}{\mm} (w) $\times$ \SI{0.5}{\mm} (d) (Figure
\ref{fig:ptelm-image}). While Kurimoto \latin{et al.} and Wang \latin{et al.}
reported the similar sizes of crystal, the shape of PTE.LM crystals did not
exhibit tomahawk form. Previously, crystals were expected to display a hatchet
morphology having a broad base (010) further bounded by (100), (110) and (011)
\cite{Kurimoto1999}.  However, due to the fluctuations from factors of pH and
drying process, the irregular shape of PTE.LM was expected. While Hourigan
\latin{et al.} reported the amorphous crystal during the crystallization, the
pH and drying process of PTE.LM should be adjusted.

\subsection{Reconstituted PTE.LM Hydrolysis Reaction}

While PTE hydrolyzed organophosphates substrates \cite{Yang2014a,Baker2011b},
it exhibited short half live, losing activity within one week (Chapter
\ref{chap:uaa}, Figure \ref{fig:kinetics-fig}). Further evidences demonstrated
that PTE required stabilization through embodiments, such as immobilization,
formulation discussed in introduction
\cite{Chen1998,Gill2000,Havens1993,Masson2009a}. To further stabilize PTE, we
crystallized the enzyme in the presence of LM and assessed its ability to
hydrolyze paraoxon after storage. After the crystallization, PTE.LM was stored
at room temperature or \SI{4}{\celsius}. One month old PTE.LM stored at
\SI{4}{\celsius} revealed activity for paraoxon hydrolysis after reconstituted
in \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} (pH 8, \SI{100}{\micro\Molar} \ce{CoCl2}) phosphate
buffer (Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-one-month}).

        \SI{200}{\micro\liter} in \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer. The

        \label{fig:ptelm-one-month} 
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

The absorbance at \SI{405}{\nm} clearly demonstrated the
increased hydrolysis of \emph{p}-nitrophenol by the one-month old PTE.LM
(Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-one-month}). The data from crystals after 2 months
storage at \SI{4}{\celsius} also demonstrated hydrolysis of paraoxon when the
protein stored in buffer is inactive (Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-two-month}). By
contrast, paraoxon saturated in the absence of PTE revealed no hydrolysis,
indicating that the PTE.LM crystals indeed were active. Assuming the same
amount of PTE within the crystal, the 2-month sample exhibited less activity
(Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-two-month}). When compared to a dread PTE sample
dissolved in buffer, the 2-month sample exhibited activity while no detectable
hydrolysis was observed with the dried stored PTE(Figure
\ref{fig:ptelm-two-month}). This suggested that the crystallization of PTE in
LM provided stability.

\end{figure}
% --------------------------

The crystallization process was scaled up to 10-fold. In the meanwhile, PTE.LM
was stored at room temperature to investigate half life and stability of
PTE.LM.  After storing at room temperature for ~3.5 months,
\SI{0.08}{\gram\per\mL} PTE.LM crystals was then reconstituted in
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer (pH 8, \SI{100}{\micro\Molar}
\ce{CoCl2}). \SIrange{13}{104}{\micro\Molar} paraoxon was then used for assays.
Within three minutes, reactions reached the maximum absorbance at
\SI{405}{\nm}. (Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-hydrolysis}) Within the linear range
of the reaction, enzyme kinetics was calculated with V\textsubscript{max} and
K\textsubscript{M}as 0.0043 $\pm$ \SI{0.0012}{\micro\Molar\per\second} and 1186
$\pm$ \SI{336}{\micro\Molar}, respectively. (Table \ref{tab:ptelm-table})
Compared to the soluble PTE, reconstituted PTE.LM demonstrated decreased
activity on both K\textsubscript{M} and Vmax values. Due to the elevated
temperature at \SI{40}{\celsius} during the crystallization process, the PTE
activity may be partially impaired from heat inactivation as observed from
Masson and Tawfik group \cite{Rochu2002b,Roodveldt2005}. However, this subtle
changes in temperature was not the only factor. The dilution of \ce{Co^{2+}} in
the active site also impacted the PTE catalytic efficiency. Raushel group
demonstrated that the metal ions deprivation in the active site led to the loss
of activity \cite{Benning1995,Samples2005}.

\subsection{FITC Conjugation And Crystallization}

To calculate the amounts of non-GFP protein in the crystal, Wang \latin{et al.}
conjugated fluorescein into protein, such as RNAse A, RNAse B, Avidin, and
NeutrAvidin \cite{Wang2001a}. Using fluorescein, the location of protein at the
(010) growth sector was visulaized. The PTE was conjugated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FTIC) to label with the lysine and C-terminus of PTE
\cite{Rogers1999}. The FITC probe has an absorption at \SI{495}{\nm} and
emission at \SI{525}{\nm}, which forms stable conjugation with free amino
groups of proteins. 
The FITC was incubated with PTE and performed dialysis at \SI{4}{\celsius}. After
dialysis, we deposited the conjugation product into LM with the same
crystallization procedure. After two weeks, we collected the crystal
(PTE.LM-FITC) and use fluorescence microscope to locate the probe conjugated
with PTE. (Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-fitc})
% --------------------------
\begin{figure}[htbp] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig3_10} 
    \caption[The image of PTE.LM-FITC crystal. An absorption at \SI{495}{\nm}
    and an emission at \SI{525}{\nm} were used for FITC probe. The crystal was

\label{fig:ptelm-fitc} 
\end{figure}
% --------------------------

From Figure \ref{fig:ptelm-fitc}, the crystal demonstrated the distribution of
PTE-FITC. Unfortunately, we did not find the (010) pattern inside the crystal.
This might be resulted from several factors, such as temperatures and pH during
the crystallization \cite{Wong2014}. As crystal visualization served as one of
goal of formulation, we also investigated the PTE stability in this study.
After collecting the PTE.LM-FITC, we reconstituted the crystal with
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} pH 8 phosphate buffer. Unlike the hydrolysis from PTE.LM,
we were not able to measure the catalytic reaction. The loss of enzyme activity
may be due to the FITC conjugation, which was previously reported by
Rogers \latin{et al.} \cite{Rogers1999}. To visualize the functional PTE inside
the crystal, especially at extremely low concentration, alternative methodology
is required in this study.

\section{Future work}

Due to the limitation of detection methods that we previously used, we were not
able to determine protein concentration via spectrophotometer or BCA. Further
quantification is needed for k\textsubscript{cat}/K\textsubscript{M}.

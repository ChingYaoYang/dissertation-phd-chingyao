- Introduction
 Rosetta and protein engineering
 Computational tools are widely used for protein engineering [ref]. Rosetta suite was first developed in University of Washington [ref]. Baker et al. adapted this suite for prediction of three dimentional structure of proteins. This suite provides a handful of proteols for analyzing and mutating protein stuctures. The simulation replies heavily on knowledge-based potentials

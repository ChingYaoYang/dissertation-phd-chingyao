\section{Methods}

\subsection{General}

All chemicals, reagents, and substrate were purchased from Sigma. T4 DNA ligase
was purchased from Roche. DNA sequence was confirmed by Eurofins MWG Operon.
96-well plates were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA)\cite{Yang2014a}.

\subsubsection{Endotoxin removal}

Protein elutions were separated from pyrogenic lipopolysaccharides using a
\ldots delete content Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific).

\subsubsection{Protein concentration}
Purified protein product was assayed for concentration by way of a Thermo

\subsubsection{Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
real-time PCR analysis} 

RNA was isolated from cell cultures using an RNeasy Mini
\ldots delete content levels were calculated according to the equation ${x=s^{- \Delta C q}}$, where
${\Delta C q = C q_{exp} - C q _{18S}}$.

inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation.

\subsection{Endotoxin levels in COMPcc protein}
\label{sec:endotoxins}

Endotoxin levels of the protein were measured using a limulus amebocyte lysate
catabolic events reported in Section \ref{sec:bms493_results}.

\subsection{Contamination of recombinant COMPcc with endotoxins}
The importance of endotoxin removal from recombinant protein preparations has

delivery of RAR/RXR antagonists and inverse agonists as demonstrated by early
evidence of down-regulating hypertrophic gene expression and terminal
differentiation.

\subsection{Future work}
% --------------------------
\label{sec:future_work_endotoxin}
These preliminary results suggest that the COMPcc does not significantly improve
the therapeutic effects of BMS493. The signal from these experiments suffers,
however, from potential noise originating from the presence of endotoxins in the
sample, possibly eliciting similar catabolic gene expression to what is
observed. While dosage experiments were performed in this study of COMPcc and
COMPcc that had undergone endotoxin removal procedures, additional control
samples can improve the confidence of these results. While LPS have been shown
to induce catabolic gene expression, known standards of LPS may be administered
to chondrocytes in future studies to gauge actual response from a positive
control. In addition, purified lysate from non-transformed BL21 (DE3)
\latin{E.coli} that undergoes endotoxin removal procedures may be used and
considered as a negative control sample group toward the testing of COMPcc
alone.

these conditions. A balance must be stricken between the solvation of BMS493 (or
any other hydrophobic/non-polar small molecule compound) and the (molecular and
meso-scale) structural integrity of the protein-based carrier.

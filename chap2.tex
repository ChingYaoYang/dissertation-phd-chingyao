\subsection{Dimer Interface of Phosphotriesterase}

\subsection{Side-chain Effects}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{General}

All chemicals, reagents, and substrate were purchased from Sigma. T4 DNA ligase
was purchased from Roche. DNA sequence was confirmed by Eurofins MWG Operon.
96-well plates were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA)\cite{Yang2014a}.

\subsection{Variants of Phosphotriesterase}
Purified protein product was assayed for concentration by way of a Thermo

\subsection{Biosynthesis}

In anticipation for the need of large quantities of protein mass for the \ldots
delete comtent of the supernatant and storage at \SI{-20}{\celsius}.

\subsection{Protein Purification}
The purification was described previously in the section
\ref{sec:protein-expression-method}. All solutions used in the extraction and
purification of recombinant proteins \ldots delete content 5 CVs of buffer
prior to each injection.

\subsection{Enzyme Kinetics}

The protein was diluted to a final concentration of \SI{30}{\nano\Molar} in
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) by using the extinction
coefficient \SI{29280}{\per\Molar\per\cm}. Reactions were monitored
spectrophotometrically (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski VT) at \SI{405}{\nm} for
paraoxon (coefficient = \SI{17000}{\per\Molar\per\cm}).  Reactions for paraoxon
(\SIrange{13}{104}{\micro\Molar}) was done in 0.4\% methanol.
K\textsubscript{M} and k\textsubscript{cat} values were determined by a
Lineweaver-Burk plot.\cite{Baker2011b} The equation used is shown below
(Eq.~\ref{eqn:MM-chap2}): 
\begin{equation} 
    \frac{1}{v} =
    \frac{K\textsubscript{M}}{V\textsubscript{max}}\times\frac{1}{S} +
    \frac{1}{V\textsubscript{max}} 
    \label{eqn:MM-chap2}
\end{equation}
where S represents substrate concentration; K\textsubscript{M} represents the
substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of
V\textsubscript{max}. The data reported is the average of three trials and the
error represents the standard deviation of those trials.

\subsection{Thermo-stability and Secondary Structure of Phosphotriesterase}

\subsubsection{Nano-DSC}

The details are described in the section \ref{sec:dsc-method}. DSC (Nano-DSC,
TA instrument, USA) was preformed by using \SI{600}{\micro\L}
(\SI{0.1}{\mg\per\mL}) of protein right after dialysis. Measurements were
conducted at a scan rate of \SI{1}{\celsius\per\minute}. Signals was blanked with
buffer under the same condition.  The observed diagram was then analyzed by
using NanoAnalyze software.

\subsubsection{Circular Dichroism}

The details are described in the section \ref{sec:cd-method}. CD spectra were
recorded on a JASCO J-815 Spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) using Spectra Manager
software. Temperature was controlled using a Fisher Isotemp Model 3016S water
bath. Proteins concentrations were \SI{10}{\micro\Molar} in
\SI{20}{\milli\Molar} phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). \SI{20}{\milli\Molar}
phosphate buffer was used for blanking signals. To calculate ellipticities, the
following formula was used(Eq.~\ref{eqn:CD-chap2}): 
\begin{equation}
    θmrw = MRW(θobs) / (10 * c * l)
    \label{eqn:CD-chap2}
\end{equation}
where \emph{MRW} is the mean residue weight of the specific phosphotriesterase,
θobs is the observed ellipticities (mdeg), \emph{l} is the path length (cm),
\emph{c} is the concentration in \SI{}{\micro\Molar}. Spectra was recorded from
\SIrange{190}{250}{\nm} with a scan speed of \SI{1}{\nano\meter\per\minute}.

Expression of COMPcc was carried out in auto-inducing media, encompassing a
\ldots delete content typical in inducible expression systems.

Auto-induction growth can be sustained in baffled shaker flasks, according to

inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation.

\subsection{Variants Enzyme Kinetics}

Endotoxin levels of the protein were measured using a limulus amebocyte lysate
catabolic events reported in Section.
